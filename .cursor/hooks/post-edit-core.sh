# post-edit-core.sh — Cursor postToolUse hook for Write/Edit tool calls.
#
# When the agent edits a file inside a core plugin directory, surface a
# reminder that any in-game test result must be preceded by install-core.sh
# and verify-core-installed.sh, or it is invalid.
#
# Why this hook exists:
#   The single most expensive failure mode in this repo is claiming a core
#   test result against a stale installed plugin while the freshly-built
#   binary sits unused in DerivedData. The protocol to prevent this is
#   already documented in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md, and the tooling already
#   exists in Scripts/. But agents (including the one that wrote this hook)
#   have demonstrably ignored that protocol. This hook is the mechanical
#   enforcement layer: every edit to a core file produces a fresh reminder
#   in the agent's tool output, which the agent has to acknowledge.
#
# This hook does not block edits. It only surfaces context.
#
# Input (stdin, JSON):
#   {
#     "tool_name": "Write" | "Edit" | "StrReplace" | ...,
#     "tool_input": { "path": "..." | "filePath": "...", ... },
#     ...
#   }
#
# Output (stdout, JSON):
#   { "additional_context": "..." }
#
# Exit code 0 always (fail-open by design — never break the agent's flow).

reminder=$(cat <<EOF
You just edited a file in the **${core}** core plugin directory (${rel_path}).

Before you (or the user) report any in-game test result for ${core}:

  1. Build:   xcodebuild -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace -scheme "OpenEmu + ${core}" -configuration <Debug|Release> -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' build
              or:    ./Scripts/verify.sh --core ${core}            (Debug)
                     ./Scripts/verify.sh --core ${core} --release  (Release)

  2. Install: ./Scripts/install-core.sh ${core} [--debug|--release]
              (verify.sh --core does this automatically)

  3. Preflight: ./Scripts/verify-core-installed.sh ${core} [--debug|--release]
                Confirm it prints "OK" before claiming any test result.

OpenEmu loads cores from ~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/Cores/, NOT
from the build directory. Skipping step 2 means OpenEmu will load the
previously installed plugin regardless of what you just built. This is the
exact failure mode that wasted hours during the FCEU grey-screen
investigation (#214).

Current preflight status:
${verify_status:-  (Scripts/verify-core-installed.sh not present yet; cannot check.)}
