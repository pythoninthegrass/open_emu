## Current Status

**Actively maintained. Running natively on Apple Silicon (no Rosetta required).**

This is a community-maintained fork of OpenEmu, rebuilt to run natively on M-series Macs. All emulation cores have been ported to ARM64. The app runs on macOS 11.0+ and has been tested on macOS Sequoia and macOS 26 (Tahoe).

## What's New

Recent highlights from active development:

- **Sony PSP** — PPSSPP-Core fully rebuilt and integrated. PSP emulation now works natively on Apple Silicon.
- **Nintendo 64** — Mupen64Plus revived and working. N64 emulation is back.
- **Sega Dreamcast** — Migrated from Reicast to Flycast. Dreamcast emulation is significantly more stable.
- **ScreenScraper cover art** — The library now automatically fetches box art from [ScreenScraper](https://www.screenscraper.fr), replacing the old manual cover art workflow entirely. Enter your credentials in Preferences → Cover Art and your library fills in automatically.
- **Core updates** — SNES9x updated to 1.63, mGBA updated to 0.10.5.
- **Pokémon Mini** — PokeMini and Potator (Watara Supervision) workspace integration fixed; both now build and run.
- **macOS 26 (Tahoe) compatibility** — Multiple fixes across the app and build system for full Tahoe support.

## What's Planned

The next major milestones on the roadmap:

- **Nintendo DS** — melonDS integration (greenfield wrapper; DeSmuME is abandoned)
- **MAME / Arcade** — system plugin is ready; emulation core integration is the remaining work
- **GameCube** — Dolphin overhaul; community fork exists, high complexity
- **Core version updates** — targeting latest stable releases across all cores

See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the full plan with implementation details.

---

## Known Issues

- A few cores have quirks on Apple Silicon still being investigated (see open issues)
- Input Monitoring permission may need to be granted manually in System Settings → Privacy & Security

---

## Requirements

- macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4)

---

## About This Project

OpenEmu is one of the best pieces of Mac software ever made — a beautifully designed, first-class game emulation frontend that brought together dozens of emulation cores under a single native macOS UI. The original project went quiet around 2022.

This fork started from [bazley82's OpenEmuARM64](https://github.com/bazley82/OpenEmuARM64), which did the foundational work of porting all 25 cores to build natively on Apple Silicon. Since then this project has diverged significantly: Nintendo 64 and Pokémon Mini were rebuilt from scratch and brought back online; PPSSPP was fully re-integrated to add PSP emulation on Apple Silicon; Dreamcast was migrated from the stale Reicast codebase to Flycast for a much more stable experience; ScreenScraper cover art was integrated to bring the library back to life; multiple core updates shipped (SNES9x 1.63, mGBA 0.10.5); and the entire app was hardened for macOS 26 (Tahoe) compatibility. The goal is to make OpenEmu genuinely great on modern Macs again — not just technically booting, but actually usable for players.

**Lineage:**
- [OpenEmu/OpenEmu](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu) — the original project, built by the OpenEmu team
- [bazley82/OpenEmuARM64](https://github.com/bazley82/OpenEmuARM64) — the ARM64 port that this fork is built on
- **This repo** — continued development and maintenance by [@nickybmon](https://github.com/nickybmon)

## A Note on AI-Assisted Development

I'm not a professional developer. I work on this project using Cursor and Claude as development assistants — they help me write and debug code I couldn't write alone. I review every change, test everything, and make all the calls about direction and quality.

I'm transparent about this because honesty with the community matters more than maintaining an illusion of expertise I don't have. The goal is to keep something good alive and make it genuinely usable for players.

## Contributing

Issues, PRs, and testing feedback are all welcome. If something breaks for you, open an issue and describe your Mac model, macOS version, and which system/game you were running. That context is the most valuable thing you can provide.

If you want to contribute code, check the open issues for good starting points. A simple PR with a clear description of what it fixes is the best kind of contribution.
