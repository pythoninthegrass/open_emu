## Current Status

**Actively maintained. Running natively on Apple Silicon (no Rosetta required).**

This is a community-maintained fork of OpenEmu, rebuilt to run natively on M-series Macs. All 25 emulation cores have been ported to ARM64. The app runs on macOS 11.0+ and has been tested on macOS Sequoia and macOS 26 (Tahoe).

> **Note:** Code signing and notarization are not yet fully sorted. On first launch, right-click the app and choose Open to bypass Gatekeeper.

## About This Project

OpenEmu is one of the best pieces of Mac software ever made — a beautifully designed, first-class game emulation frontend that brought together dozens of emulation cores under a single native macOS UI. The original project went quiet around 2022.

This fork started from [bazley82's OpenEmuARM64](https://github.com/bazley82/OpenEmuARM64), which did the foundational work of porting all 25 cores to build natively on Apple Silicon. I've continued to work in my own build for fun and to get soemthing working for myself and others that i'm happy with — fixing macOS 26 compatibility issues, hardening the build, and setting up community infrastructure to keep the project alive. I've also tried to preserve as much of the original build that made it great while getting it working on newer MacOS and Swift versions.

**Lineage:**
- [OpenEmu/OpenEmu](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu) — the original project, built by the OpenEmu team
- [bazley82/OpenEmuARM64](https://github.com/bazley82/OpenEmuARM64) — the ARM64 port that this fork is built on
- **This repo** — continued development and maintenance by [@chris-p-bacon-sudo](https://github.com/chris-p-bacon-sudo)

## A Note on AI-Assisted Development

I'm not a professional developer. I work on this project using Cursor and Claude as development assistants — they help me write and debug code I couldn't write alone. I review every change, test everything, and make all the calls about direction and quality.

I'm transparent about this because honesty with the community matters more than maintaining an illusion of expertise I don't have. The goal is to keep something good alive and make it genuinely usable for players.

## Contributing

Issues, PRs, and testing feedback are all welcome. If something breaks for you, open an issue and describe your Mac model, macOS version, and which system/game you were running. That context is the most valuable thing you can provide.

If you want to contribute code, check the open issues for good starting points. A simple PR with a clear description of what it fixes is the best kind of contribution.
