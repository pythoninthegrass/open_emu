## How to test locally

```bash
# 1. Check out this PR
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER> --repo nickybmon/OpenEmu-Silicon

# 2. Build — use the scheme that covers the changed target.
#    For main app changes: -scheme OpenEmu
#    For Flycast core changes: -scheme "OpenEmu + Flycast" with 'clean build'
#    (incremental builds will not recompile core C++ files)
xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  build 2>&1 | tail -20

# 3. Resolve the exact build products dir for this workspace (avoids matching other worktrees)
BUILD_PRODUCTS=$(xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null \
  | awk '/^\s+BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/{print $3; exit}')

# 4. If this PR touches a core (Flycast, etc.), install the rebuilt binary:
#    cp -f "$BUILD_PRODUCTS/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin/Contents/MacOS/<CoreName>" \
#      ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenEmu/Cores/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin/Contents/MacOS/<CoreName>

# 5. Launch
open "$BUILD_PRODUCTS/OpenEmu.app"
```

<!-- Replace <PR_NUMBER> with this PR's number. Add any PR-specific setup steps here (e.g. BIOS files needed, permissions to revoke first, specific ROM to test with). -->
