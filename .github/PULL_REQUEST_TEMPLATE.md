## How to test locally

The PR number below is filled in automatically — just paste the whole block. For Flycast use `-scheme "OpenEmu + Flycast"` with `clean build`; for Mednafen use `-scheme "OpenEmu + Mednafen" -configuration Release`.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Cursor/Open\ Emu
gh pr checkout NUMBER --repo nickybmon/OpenEmu-Silicon
./Scripts/verify.sh
./Scripts/launch-debug.sh
```

`verify.sh` builds, prunes stale DerivedData, and runs a codesign check. `launch-debug.sh` picks the freshest Debug build without using a glob (which opens multiple instances when DerivedData has more than one hash directory).

If this PR touches a core, install it before launching:

```bash
./Scripts/install-core.sh <CoreName>
./Scripts/launch-debug.sh
```

`install-core.sh` quits OpenEmu first, copies files correctly, and re-signs the bundle.

<!-- Add any PR-specific setup here (BIOS files, permissions to revoke, specific ROM to test with). -->
