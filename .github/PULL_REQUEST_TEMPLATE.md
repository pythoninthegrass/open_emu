## How to test locally

Replace `NUMBER` with this PR's number, then paste the whole block. For Flycast use `-scheme "OpenEmu + Flycast"` with `clean build`; for Mednafen use `-scheme "OpenEmu + Mednafen" -configuration Release`.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Cursor/Open\ Emu
gh pr checkout NUMBER --repo nickybmon/OpenEmu-Silicon
xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  build 2>&1 | tail -20
DEBUG_DIR=$(ls -dt ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/OpenEmu-*/Build/Products/Debug 2>/dev/null | head -1)
codesign --force --deep --sign - "$DEBUG_DIR/OpenEmu.app"
open "$DEBUG_DIR/OpenEmu.app"
```

If this PR touches a core, install it before the `open` line:

```bash
cp -R "$DEBUG_DIR/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin" \
  ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenEmu/Cores/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin
codesign --force --sign - \
  ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenEmu/Cores/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin
```

<!-- Add any PR-specific setup here (BIOS files, permissions to revoke, specific ROM to test with). -->
