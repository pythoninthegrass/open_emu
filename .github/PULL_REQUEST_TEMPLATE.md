## How to test locally

```bash
# 1. Check out this PR (run from your local clone)
cd ~/Documents/Cursor/Open\ Emu
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER> --repo nickybmon/OpenEmu-Silicon

# 2. Build — replace -scheme OpenEmu with the scheme covering your change
# For Flycast: -scheme "OpenEmu + Flycast" with clean build
# For Mednafen: -scheme "OpenEmu + Mednafen" -configuration Release
xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  build 2>&1 | tail -20

# 3. Launch (if this PR touches a core, install it first — see note below)
BUILD_PRODUCTS=$(xcodebuild \
  -workspace OpenEmu-metal.xcworkspace \
  -scheme OpenEmu \
  -configuration Debug \
  -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null \
  | awk '/^\s+BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/{print $3; exit}')
open "$BUILD_PRODUCTS/OpenEmu.app"

# Core install (if needed):
# cp -R "$BUILD_PRODUCTS/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin" \
#   ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenEmu/Cores/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin
# codesign --force --sign - \
#   ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenEmu/Cores/<CoreName>.oecoreplugin
```
