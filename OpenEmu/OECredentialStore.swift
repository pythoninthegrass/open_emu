///
/// ## Why not keychain?
/// macOS ties keychain item access to the binary's code signature. Every app update
/// produces a new signature, which makes the OS prompt "Allow / Always Allow" again.
/// For the low-stakes tokens OpenEmu stores (cover-art passwords, achievement tokens,
/// a Drive OAuth refresh token) that friction outweighs the marginal security benefit.
///
/// ## How this works instead
/// 1. A 256-bit encryption key is derived from the machine's hardware UUID and the
///    app's bundle ID using HKDF-SHA256. The key is deterministic — same machine,
///    same app, always the same key — so it never needs to be stored anywhere.
/// 2. All credentials are kept as a `[String: String]` dictionary, serialised to JSON,
///    and encrypted with AES-GCM.
/// 3. The sealed blob is written to `~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/.oe_credentials`.
///
/// Reads and writes are fast (local file I/O + in-process AES) and never trigger any
/// OS permission dialogs.
///
/// ## Thread safety
/// All access is serialised through a private dispatch queue. Call `get`, `set`, and
/// `remove` from any thread.
