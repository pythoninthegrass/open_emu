#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build-for-worktree.sh — Build OpenEmu to a stable per-branch path so
# macOS privacy permissions persist across rebuilds of the same branch.
#
# Why: macOS binds permissions (Input Monitoring, Accessibility, etc.) to
# a specific app path + code signature. Xcode's default DerivedData uses a
# random hash per checkout — every fresh worktree = different path = lost
# permissions. This script forces a stable path: ~/Builds/openemu/<branch>/.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/build-for-worktree.sh                  # builds the OpenEmu scheme
#   ./Scripts/build-for-worktree.sh "OpenEmu + FCEU" # builds a specific scheme
#
# After building once, grant Input Monitoring (and any other permissions you
# need) to the printed app path in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
# Subsequent builds of the same branch land at the same path and inherit
# the granted permissions automatically.
#
# See docs/worktree-workflow.md for the full workflow and known caveats.
